The project is based on a catalogue of clothes for dogs. That was the base idea for the project.
The original theme was just an example, for this project I needed to create a React and Redux SPA - that had a home page for browsing through the catalogue items, and a details page for one of the catalogue items.

For this project I decided to use the [TMDB - API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to create a Movie Catalogue.

On the Home page, when you first enter the app, you can see a list of todays most popular movies. Through there you can either open one of the listed movies, or search for a different movie.
